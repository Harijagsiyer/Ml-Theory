    "* Because of the simplicity of its depiction, linear regression is an appealing model.\n",

    "\n",
    "* The linear equation provides one scale factor for every input parameter or column, which is denoted by the capital Greek letter Beta (B). One more coefficient is added, which gives the line an additional degree of freedom (e.g., going up and down on a two-dimensional plot) and is frequently referred to as the intercept or the bias coefficient.\n",
